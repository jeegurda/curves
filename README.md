### Bezier curves length

Calculating cubic Bezier curve length by flattening using De Casteljau's algorithm.

It also demonstrates sequential interpolation points. You can traverse (t0) by mouseover.

You can view it here: http://jeegurda.github.io/curves/

Or you can run it at http://localhost:3000:
```bash
$ npm i
$ npm run dev
```

Or you can build it to /build
```bash
$ npm i
$ npm run build
```

#### Todo:

- quadric curves
- add any high-order curves
- add Legendre-Gauss method for the "true" length
