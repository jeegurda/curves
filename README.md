### Bezier curves length

Calculating cubic Bezier curve length by flattening using De Casteljau's algorithm.

It also demonstrates sequential interpolation points. You can traverse (t0) by mouseover.

#### Todo:

- quadric curves
- add any high-order curves
- add Legendre-Gauss method for the "true" length
